# Genetic programming in sloving doulbe pendulum problem

## Abstract

Reinforcement learning has been widely used for solving sequential decision tasks. The difference in control performance by using Markov and non-Markov in double pendulums problem are investigated. It is demonstrated that non-Markov provide a higher control accuracy than Markov solution. However, it still has some drawback with spending longer settling time in the step response and composed by a complex solution structure.

* This project is implemented by C++
* The source code of the pendulum movement system is sohown in the code folder
* The detail information of the project is demonstrated in the IEEE report
